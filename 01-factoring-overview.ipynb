Although research has yielded algorithms that perform faster than the intuitive trial division, including Fermat's algorithm, Pollard's two algorithms, and sieve algorithms, it's still an open question whether a classical algorithm exists that can factor in [polynomial time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).

For factoring, the problem's constraints are that the two variables representing factors, $a$ and $b$, be assigned only natural numbers and that their multiplication be equal to the factored number, $P$. \n",

Given $N$ variables $x_1,...,x_N$, where each variable $x_i$ can have binary values $0$ or $1$, the quantum computer finds assignments of values that minimize the QUBO\n",

    "\n",
    "There are different ways to formulate the factoring problem as a BQM. Formulation A starts with an intuitive one. \n",

    "## Formulation A\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\" style=\"margin: 10px\">Skip this subsection if you prefer to move on to what this notebook codes. Or try implementing it yourself as an exercise, although this is not the recommended formulation.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can solve an equation, say $x+1=2$, by minimizing the square of the subtraction of one side from another, $\\min_x[2-(x+1)]^2$. Intuitively such a minimization seeks the shortest distance between the sides, which occurs at equality, with the square eliminating negative distance. \n",

    "For a factored number, $P$, to be equal to its factors, $a, b$, you can solve  $P=ab$ with the minimization\n",

    "D-Wave quantum computers solve binary *quadratic* models so this now-binary minimization should not have terms with higher order than $a_ib_j$. However, squaring $(P-ab)$ introduces non-quadratic terms for problems of any decent size. You would therefore use [order reduction](https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/handbook_reformulating.html) techniques on all higher terms. For example, by introducing a new variable $x_k=a_0b_2$, you can replace a non-quadratic term such as $8b_0b_2a_0^2$ with quadratic term $8b_0x_k$ (notice that $a_0^2=a_0$), and do so repeatedly until all terms are linear or quadratic. \n",

    "This Jupyter Notebook showed how you can formulate a constraint satisfaction problem for solution on a quantum computer using Ocean software. You solved a factoring problem as an example of one proposed solution technique.   \n",

    "You saw two ways of formulating the factoring problem. Formulation A is intuitive and direct, but conversion of large integers to binary introduces (a) increasing weights per bit, $2^ma_m$, and (b) in the squaring of $(P-ab)$, terms of higher order that need to be reduced to quadratic. These affect performance. Formulation B, using binary gates, is a useful technique in general. The modularity of binary gates provides some benefits for minor-embedding: repeated small units that can be tiled onto the QPU's topology.       "
